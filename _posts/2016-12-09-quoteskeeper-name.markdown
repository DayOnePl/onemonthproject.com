Hey,

today we want to describe one of the most important elements in developing products … picking the name. 

Typical scenario, when you begin creating a product is:

- come up with an idea for app
- choose technologies to use
- pick a name
- pick a good name
- pick a better name …

Choosing a name is often kind of blocker. We like to focus on picking a name because this is relatively easy, doesn’t require any action and gives the impression we’re working on our product, when in reality we are just procrastinating. If you wanted to start app or blog, you probably know what I mean. I don’t want to say that name is not important, but for sure there is a lot of work and wasting time on choosing a name won’t help to succeed in the end. So how did we choose Quotes Keeper?

Of course, in the beginning, we wasted a bit of time to brainstorm, even before we started developing. But quickly we just chose codename - Quotes. We decided to go back to that decision and just start working. After a while, we knew we need a name to make a landing page, prepare logo etc. Once again, we made brainstorm and pick about 20-30 names. There were strange ideas like Sentus, Azure Quotes, Duskbook, Rommanum, Cito and many others.

Whenever we came up with any name, we were checking if web address for our landing page is available. We knew we wanted .com domain and that could be just name of app like [quoteskeeper.com](http://www.quoteskeeper.com)
From our big list of names we’ve chosen 7 names and created simple Google Form.

 We’ve sent a form to our friends, to some Skype lists, posted on FB. We got more than 20 replies and the best ones were: Quintus Quotes and Quotes Keeper.  To make final decision we voted.

That’s the history how we’ve chosen Quotes Keeper - of course, [quoteskeeper.com](http://www.quoteskeeper.com) was available.

Eat broccoli and workout,
