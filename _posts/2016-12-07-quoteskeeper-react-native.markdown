Good Morning Ladies and Gentlemen.

Everything has already started with our second announced project - Quotes Keeper.
We've already begun development works and our graphics designer is already preparing UI sketches.

When it comes to developing mobile app there is one decision you need to make that will significantly affect development: 

- create an app with native technologies
- use web technologies embedded within the web view

But still, if you want to have a fast and good looking app you have to go with native. Fortunately, there seems to be one more alternative - React Native.

React Native promise shorter development time with almost no drawbacks since it uses native components under the hood. This way we could leverage our existing React experience, play with fancy new technologies and test if RN delivers on its promises.

We have just started using it and the very first thing we noticed is the incredible experience of an instant feedback loop. Compared with recompilation and restart of the app on simulator or phone, a refresh of React Native app is just a breeze. Weâ€™ll give the whole impression after we finish development, so stay tuned.

In a day or two, you should also see a landing page with main features and mailing list subscription up and running. We'll be also running some small marketing campaign and trying to attract as much interest as possible.

As you see, there's much stuff going on and even more to come. We can't wait to share actual screens from the app development with you.

Wish you all a very productive day.
