Hello and good to see you again after the weekend.

The second app we are currently working on is called "Quotes Keeper". It is a simple app that allows to collect and manage favourite quotes. It can also be used to save fragments of books or articles for later reference. Of course nothing stops you from writing down something funny or profound someone close to you said. That’s all, it is a simple app to store quotes with additional info about author, source and tags.

What is our motivation to create app for quotes?
We wanted to create it much earlier, since the one we have used [Quotebook](http://quotebookapp.com/) was lacking some features and synchronization was working really bad.  Recently, it turned out Quotebook is [no longer available at the AppStore](https://blog.lickability.com/the-end-of-quotebook-9e19b5653cc9#). We think that was very good and niche app. What’s more, there is no good alternative, so we’ll create our own.

This is how the app looks now.

Currently we are developing iOS version and preparing a landing page. In further posts we will describe, how the process of choosing the name went down and we will say how we have created the landing page.

Live long and prosper,
Maciek
