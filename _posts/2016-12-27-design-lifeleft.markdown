Hi there,

today I want to describe how our design process looks like for apps, I mean really high-level design. I’ll take a look at Life Left, but the idea is similar to all stuff we’re working on. 

As you know, we are a group of three, a group of three developers. After years of experience, one thing I can take for granted is that developers have almost nothing in common with designers. To be precise developers make really awful designs. Of course, there are some exceptions, but still, those are just exceptions… We’re in the majority… That’s why we can spend any amount of time designing application and probably it will still look bad. The only things we can do is to provide some ideas or concepts of screens. After we brainstorm, we collect the best ideas and discuss them with a real designer. 

For Life Left, we had several ideas for the design of the main screen. We have concluded that there needs to be the main screen presenting that time is passing by, a screen presenting our thoughts, a screen for entering and presenting thought. We’re still struggling with the main screen. The main purpose of the app is to realize that days are flying by and we have fewer days than yesterday. At the same time, we want our app to motivate people to take action, to make something meaningful every day, to go for their dreams.

In the beginning, we have created the main screen by ourselves and it looked like this:

![My design soul]({{site.url}}/img/lifeleft_design_1.png){: style="height: 400px; display: block; margin:30px auto"}

That is an effect of really hard work from my designer soul and probably that’s max what I could prepare. Then we got some suggestion from our designer:

![Designer suggestion]({{site.url}}/img/lifeleft_design_2.png){: style="height: 400px; display: block; margin:30px auto"}

Our first idea was to present life as the journey through the mountain. Then we came up with an idea to show the tree as life symbol. Currently, our designer is preparing some suggestions for trees and we’ll see how it looks.

My main takeaway from designing process is that it’s waste of time to try style app for your own if you know you don’t have those skills. In the end, it’s much more expensive than to delegate design work to competent people. Always keep in mind that doing anything on your own is not free,  although you don’t pay money for it.

Eat broccoli and work out,
