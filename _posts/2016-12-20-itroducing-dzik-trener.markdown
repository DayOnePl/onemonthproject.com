The third app in our challenge will be created in partnership with [DzikKomando](http://dzikkomando.pl/).
DzikKomando is a training studio with very personal and individual approach to fitness and workouts.
They are also a group of ~~fanatics~~ enthusiasts who participate in many team-running events.

To keep it short, they need an app that would track each memberâ€™s progress with a lot of
[gamification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification) involved to make training and learning new skills more fun and enjoyable.
They need to keep track of each training, progress in a specific skill,
and all this has to be expressed on a character card with level and experience.
This way every workout can improve your training avatar, which gives a sense of accomplishment
before you will be able to "feel" the results in real life.

This app will be built with [ReactNative](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).
You can read what are our thoughts about this technology [in the previous post](http://www.onemonthproject.com/2016/12/16/quoteskeeper-react-native.html).
However, this time we will start with an Android app first, to reach more people and then
we will add iOS. This should be relatively easy at that point with ReactNative.

Wish us luck!
