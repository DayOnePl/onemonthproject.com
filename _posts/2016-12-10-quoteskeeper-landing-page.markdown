Hi,

The road so far for Quotes Keeper looked like this:

- initial idea and concept
- start development
- create design
- pick a name

The next task was to create a landing page. There are many templates already created so the challenge was to find something simple and well-designed. Of course, there is well-known [themeforest](https://themeforest.net/), but number of possible themes is overwhelming. That’s why we focused on something much smaller. After browsing available templates on [html5up.net](https://html5up.net/) and [startbootstrap.com](https://startbootstrap.com/) we’ve finally settled on [this beauty](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/new-age/).

Choosing landing page theme is one thing, but choosing colors is totally different story, especially since we’re not designers and our only argument is: “This looks fine”. To correspond with our design we picked papaya as our main theme. Then, we removed not needed sections and added mockups photos of our app.

We provided a brief description of the most important features of Quotes Keeper and thanks to [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) we were able to provide a form for collecting emails without any backend.

Finally, our landing page is [here](http://quoteskeeper.com)

We are very happy with the final result. We are very interested in what you think about it, so don’t be shy and comment below.

Live long and prosper,

Maciek
